hdf5 (1.10.3+repack-1~exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

  Starting with release 1.10.3 the HDF Group is no longer providing the
  source for the HDF5 User's Guide and the Reference Manual.
  The latest documentation is on the support portal only [1], which is
  freely available. However, it's not easily downloadable.
