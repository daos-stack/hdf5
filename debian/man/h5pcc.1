.TP
<compile line>
\- the normal compile line options for your compiler.
.TP
h5pcc uses the same compiler you used to compile
HDF5. Check with your compiler's man pages for more
information on which options are needed.
.IP
You can override the compiler, linker, and whether or not to use static
or shared libraries to compile your program by setting the following
environment variables accordingly:
.TP
HDF5_CC
\-  use a different C compiler
.TP
HDF5_CLINKER
\-  use a different linker
.TP
HDF5_USE_SHLIB=[yes|no]
\-  use shared or static version of the HDF5 library
.TP
[default: no except when built with only
shared libraries]
.IP
You can also add or change paths and flags to the compile line using
the following environment varibles or by assigning them to their counterparts
in the 'Things You Can Modify to Override...' section of h5pcc
.TP

Note that adding library paths to HDF5_LDFLAGS where another hdf5 version
is located may link your program with that other hdf5 library version.
